## What is NISR?

**NISR** is a **multilingual, beginner-friendly programming language** designed to **break language barriers in coding** by enabling people—especially across Africa and underserved communities—to **learn and create using their native languages**.

More than just a tool, **NISR** is a **movement to make programming universally accessible, inclusive, and culturally relevant**. By combining **localized learning** with **lightweight tools**, it **empowers children, students, and beginners—even in rural areas—to solve real-world problems, foster innovation, and become part of a diverse global developer community**.


This guide helps new users quickly learn how to write, compile, and run their first NISR programs.
